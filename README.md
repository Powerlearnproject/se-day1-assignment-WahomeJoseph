#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles like modulrity, flexibility to develop, maintain and manage software systems.
It uses different methodologies, tools to ensure that system built are reliable, efficient, durable, secure and that they meet all customer requirements and preferences.
It is very essential in the technology industry since it ensures that all software products are built in a controlled and efficient manner, ensuring that they are not vulnerable to any threats as well as the products are of high quality, scalable and easily maintainable

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Bith of Software Engineering:(1968) The formal field of software engineering was established in 1968 with the introduction of fundamental principles and techniques.
Agile Methodologies' Emergence (2001): revolutionized software development by emphasizing client involvement, iterative approaches, and adaptability.
The Rise of DevOps (2009): accelerated release cycles, better team cooperation, and automation to improve the software delivery process.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning Requirements Gathering and Analysis:
  Planning is very crucial in software enginnering; includes the scope, objectives and resource for the project.
  Requirements gathering is facilitated by the developers of the projects from customers and stakeholders inputs and surveys. This information from the research and analysis     is becomes the building block basis for the project. 
  
Design:
  This stage involves creating the architecture and design of the project. All the requirements are assessesd and all factors evaluated; from where the most logical and          practical design is chosen for development.
  
Implementation:
   Fundamental development of the product starts. Developers use a specific programming language as per their preference and design to code. Programming tools are integrated      in the programming including; compilers,debuggers, interpreters which are language specific as per the software regulations.
   
Testing:
   After development phase, the software built is subjected to a series of tests to ensure smooth working. Different methodologies in coorporate testing at different stages of    development; despite this testing is done by both users (Beta testing) and by developers(Alpha testing)
   
Deployment and Maintenanace:
   A well tested software product is deloyed to users as per the organisations strategy. This is done in bits ensuring every component works smoothly along with traning           users on how to go about it. The fully deployed system is often checked for maintenance and iprovement as per changing user requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

1. Waterfall Model:
   It is a software development model which is the basis of all other models. It is simple to use and incoorporate. Each development phase is comleted fully before going to       the next phase. Once a development phase is complete, there is no going back, making it less flexible hence difficult to acommodate changing user reqirements.
   Despite this model not being popular nowdays, some systems like that of a hospital would be build based on this model.

3. Agile Model:
   Software developmemt model which entails building a system in pahases which are dynamic in nature; this model acommodates changes in user reqirements in course of the          development process. It facilitates quick project completion. When a development phase is completed, there is still a chance for developers to revisit the development phase    and include the new changes by the users.
   It can be used in multiple systems including a bank system to acommodate different users requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer:
   In software engineering, this is the person or team responsible for designing, coding, programming, testing, deploying and maintaining software applications in an              organisation. They work on different softwares and use different languages to build systems that meet user requiremnts.
   
3. Quality Assurance Engineer:
   QA ensures that the softwares built meet the required standards and quality. They are responsible for executing test plans to identify any bugs and errors and consequently     work with developers to resolve the issues.
   
5. Project Manager:
   They are responsible for the whole project including planning, execution and closing of the project, all project activities happen under their watch. They oversee the          projects progress, manage resources, set working timelines and ensure that the project is within its budget and all objectives are achieved correctly and effectively.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE: Comprehensive software application which provides developers with necessary tools to write, test and debug code.
     Most IDEs have integrated debugging tools which help developers to set breakpoints hence make it easier for the to fix and debug their codes.
     Provide a centralized workspace where developers can write, test and dbug their programs.
     Provide features like code assistance for syntax highlighting, error checking, code improvement suggestions hence efficient codes.
     
VCS: Softwae with tools that helps manage changes in a source code.It also tracks the modification of the code and facilitate collaboration between different developers and         contributors in aproject.     
    It enables developers to collaborate when working on a project simultaneously.
    Provides backup and history, to store code bases as well as store code for recovery in case of data loss.
    
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing:
   This is testing on individual components of the system; testing sample codes independently to ensure they work as intended.
   It assists in early bug detection hence making it easier for fixing.
   Makes the code more reliable; with clear outlined components working correctly creates a stable software foundation.
   
3. Integration Testing:
   Focuses on verifying the interaction between different modules or components of the software ensuring that combined parts work together as expected.
   Helps identify any underlying issues in the integrated user interface components.
   Ensures that data processed and transferred between modules is correct.
   
5. System Testing:
   Involves making tests on the complete and integrated system as a whole to ensure that it meets all user requirements.
   Confirms that the entire system functions correctly according to the specified user requirements in the real-world environment.
   Includes testing all functional and non-functional requirements of the system including performance,security and usability.
   
7. Acceptance Testing:
   It is conducted typically by client or end-user to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for delivery to the customer.
   Ensures that the software meets the customerâ€™s expectations and requirements before being handed over.
   Validates the software against real-world scenarios and other existing systems to ensure it provides the desired value and functionality.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is designing questions or commands more specifically to effectively communicate with AI hence optimize the quality and relevance of their response
 Enhances Response Accuracy: Well-designed prompts help AI models understand the context and intent more clearly, leading to more accurate and relevant answers.
 Reduce Misunderstanding: Precise prompts minimize the chances of misinterpretation by the AI, ensuring that responses are correct and relevant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: 
"Tell me about marketing"
Clear Prompt:
"Explain the key diffrences between digital marketing an traditional marketing"

Concise: The prompt is direct to the point hence easier for AI to understand.
Specific: The prompt narrows down to specfically differences hence provie a targetted response. 
Clear: Remove any ambiguity by specifying the detils of the question.
